' ---- Notes: 1 paragraph each (actors + use cases) ----

note right of Primary
The Renter is the primary actor who uses RentMate to find properties or equipment to rent.
They browse listings using search and filters, may ask the GenAI concierge for guidance,
and complete a booking by selecting dates and confirming payment. The renter’s goal is to
secure a suitable rental efficiently while following platform rules and policies.
end note

note right of Secondary
The Host is a secondary actor who provides inventory to the marketplace by creating and
maintaining listings for properties or equipment. The host manages rental availability,
reviews booking requests when applicable, and ensures listing information (pricing, rules,
and descriptions) is accurate. The host’s goal is to rent out items safely and reliably.
end note

note bottom of UC_Search
This use case allows the renter to search and filter listings by category (property/equipment),
location, price range, and desired rental confirmation window. The system retrieves matching
listings and displays key information (title, price, location, and availability) so the renter
can quickly evaluate options and navigate to a listing detail page for further review.
end note

note bottom of UC_Chat
This use case provides an interactive GenAI concierge experience that helps the renter clarify
their needs and discover suitable rentals. The chatbot asks questions (dates, budget, location,
and item type), answers common FAQs (policies, deposits, rules), and then recommends listings
based on the renter’s constraints. It extends Search by assisting the renter in refining criteria.
end note

note bottom of UC_Book
This use case begins when the renter selects a listing and proposes rental dates. The system
checks availability, creates a booking request, and (optionally) routes it to the host for approval
depending on the project’s chosen workflow. When approved (or auto-approved), the booking proceeds
to payment so the renter can confirm the reservation and the system can reserve the dates.
end note

note bottom of UC_Pay
This use case completes the booking by collecting payment through a prototype payment process.
The system calculates the amount due from dates and price-per-day (plus optional deposit), records
a transaction, updates the booking status to CONFIRMED, and generates a receipt for the renter.
For the course project, payment can be simulated without integrating a real payment gateway.
end note

note bottom of UC_List
This use case enables the host to create, edit, deactivate, or remove listings for properties or
equipment. The host provides core attributes such as title, description, category, location, pricing,
rules, and optional images. The system validates required fields, stores the listing, and makes it
searchable when marked active so renters can discover it in the marketplace.
end note

note bottom of UC_Avail
This use case allows the host to define and maintain availability for each listing by blocking dates
or setting open rental windows. The system stores availability slots and uses them during booking to
prevent double-booking. This use case includes Manage Listings because availability management is
performed in the context of a particular listing owned by the host.
